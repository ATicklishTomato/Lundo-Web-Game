    <h1>The Rules Of Lündo</h1><br>
    <p>The rules of Ludo, and by extension Lündo, are very simple.<br>
    In this form of Ludo, there are only two players, instead of 2-4 players.<br>
    You either play as Regirock or Regice. The first person to get all the Regis to the end, wins the game.<br>
    All your Regis start in their Pokeballs. You may take a Regi out of the Pokeball starting zone and put them on the track when you roll a 6 with the die.<br>
    If you do not have any Regi on the board and do not roll a 6, your turn is over.<br><br>
    If you do roll six, you can choose to either move a Regi you have on the board, or bring out a new one. Then you may roll again.<br>
        In Ludo and Lündo, passing is <b>not</b> allowed. If your selected Regi is blocked by the opponent's Regi, it cannot move and you must either move a different Regi or pass your move.<br>
    To help with this, you can make pawns 'faint'. This can be done by rolling the exact number of steps needed to match another pawn's position.<br>
    When this happens, you may move your Regi to the square the other Regi is in, and then the opponent's Regi which previously occupied the square gets sent back to its Pokeball.<br>
    Then the Regi that was sent back must once again roll 6 to come onto the board and start its journey anew.<br>
    The fainting rule does not apply when two or more Regis of one type are stacked on a square to form a wall. A wall is impassable by the opponent and Regis cannot be captured from it.<br><br>
        When coming within 6 steps of your final square, you must be careful, as you <b>must</b> throw the exact number of steps required to make it onto the final square.<br>
    If you roll less than it takes to get to the final square, you may move those squares (or forfeit your turn).<br>
    If you roll higher than the steps needed to make it, you will either need to move another Regi (if possible), or forfeit your turn.<br>
    You must throw the exact steps required.<br><br><br>
        These are the rules of Lündo. We wish you the best of luck in your games and we hope you enjoy!</p>
